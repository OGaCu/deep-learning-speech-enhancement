# Speech Enhancement from Noise Filtration

### Background
Speech enhancement is fundamentally a task of extracting desired speech signals from noisy environments. Spectral-masking model approaches speech problems by learning to generate a mask that is multiplied to the original audio. The mask not only hightlights speech components while suppressing noise components. This technique is computationally efficient compared to directly predicting clean speech, as the model only needs to learn the difference between clean and noisy signals rather than reconstructing the entire waveform from scratch like in traditional method of waveform-masking. 

Implemented and trained PyTorch based deep neural network models that produce a clean, enhanced speech and perform noise filtration tasks. 

This technique serves as a critical component for **voice assistants** such as Siri and Alexa, where enhanced speech signals significantly improve the accuracy of automated speech detection and recognition.

## Setup

#### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OGaCu/speech-enhancement.git
```

#### 2. Install dependencies
Ensure Python is installed, then run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes
- If you would like to train your own model, you may need access to High Performance Computing services, which is designed to support computationally intensive research across disciplines with a focus on simulations, data modeling, and AI.
- Special thanks to Dr. Maha Ali and Alyssa Anderson

## Troubleshooting
- **No wav files found**: Make sure they exist under `audio` with the correct names.
